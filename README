[ Description ]
gtk-splitter can split files into smaller pieces and combine them back together. It can also generate
a DOS batch file so that the split files can be combined on DOS/Windows systems. gtk-splitter is good
for working around file limitations with floppy disks, email attachments, etc. gtk-splitter is coded
and tested on Linux, but should work on other POSIX systems.
