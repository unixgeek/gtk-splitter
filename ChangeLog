	between the buttons and their respective text entry boxes. 

	* dostextfile.c:

2002-04-08  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

2002-04-06  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	Disabled the ability to choose a file when selecting the output directory.

2002-03-11  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* AUTHORS, configure.in, Makefile.am, README, src/Makefile.am, TODO:
        Modified the GNU distribution files.

        * split.c:
	When combining files using a batchfile, the original file name is now outputted.  
        The user doesn't have to remember what the file name was before it got changed to be DOS
        compatible.

2002-03-08  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog, configure.in, INSTALL, install-sh, Makefile.am, missing, mkinstalldirs, 
          NEWS, README, src/Makefile.am, TODO:
	First attempt at using autoconf and automake.

2002-03-04  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* dostextfile.h, error.c, error.h, file_selection.c, file_selection.h, globals.h, gtk-splitter.c,
          progress.c, progress.h, split.c, split.h, callbacks.c, callbacks.h, 
          combine.c, combine.h, dostextfile.c, Makefile:
	Re-arranged the directory layout.  Source files are now in src/.

2002-03-01  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* dostextfile.c, split.c:
	Fixed a bug in dostextfile.c where ONLY file names longer than 12 characters would have spaces
        converted to underscores.  All file names that contain spaces should have the spaces converted
        to underscores when dealing with batchfiles.

	* combine.c, split.c:
	Cleaned up the code in split.c and added some comments.

	* combine.c:
	Added some comments and tried to clean up the code a little.

2002-02-27  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* dostextfile.h, split.c, dostextfile.c:
	Fixed a bug in dosify_filename that would mangle the file extension for file names that were
        between 13 and 15(?) characters long.

	* dostextfile.c, dostextfile.h:
	Fixed an oversight in the license information.

	* dostextfile.c, dostextfile.h, Makefile, split.c:
	Made the necessary adjustments to accommodate the change of batchfile to dostextfile.

	* batchfile.c, batchfile.h, dostextfile.c, dostextfile.h:
	Changed the name of the batchfile module to a more fitting name:  dostextfile.

	* callbacks.c, callbacks.h, combine.c, globals.h, split.c:
	Commented code in callbacks.
	Changed the value of UPDATE_INTERVAL from 4k to 32k; split/combine process is now much faster.

2002-02-26  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* batchfile.c, batchfile.h, split.c:
	Removed two functions from batchfile.c and placed that functionality back into split.c.
        batchfile.c should now be fully modularized like progress.c, error.c, and file_selection.c.
        error.c, progress.c, and batchfile.c are written with code re-use in mind.  
        file_selection.c is a bit more proprietary and thus not as re-usable.

	* progress.c:
	Removed an unnecessary include directive.

	* gtk-splitter.desktop:
	Added a 'Comment' descriptor.

	* file_selection.c, globals.h:
	Added some more comments.  Removed code that was commented out.

	* globals.h:
	Fixed an incorrect declaration of an enumerated type.  
        Looking back, I am not sure how this even worked in the first place. :)

	* callbacks.c, callbacks.h, file_selection.c, file_selection.h, globals.h, gtk-splitter.c, 
          Makefile:
	Pulled a few functions out of callbacks that were related to file selection and created
        a module for them.

2002-02-23  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* batchfile.c, globals.h, gtk-splitter.c:
	Cleaned up and commented code.

	* callbacks.c, combine.c, error.c, gtk-splitter.c, progress.c, progress.h, split.c:
	Removed the duplicate error data.
	Added two new functions to progress.c
	Cleaned up and commented code in progress.c and error.c.

2002-02-22  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* callbacks.c, combine.c, error.c, globals.h, gtk-splitter.c, Makefile, split.c:
	Modified the Makefile for a better install.
	Removed some no longer needed commented code.

	* batchfile.h, callbacks.h, combine.h, error.c, error.h, globals.h, progress.h, split.h:
	Corrected some header declarations.

2002-02-11  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* Makefile: 
        Replaced cp with install.

	Renamed the todo file to the GNU standard :).

	* HOSTS:
	Added new hosts to the HOSTS file.

2002-02-01  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* /cvsroot/gtk-splitter/gtk-splitter/HOSTS:
	List of websites where gtk-splitter can be found.

2002-01-31  gunter  <techgunter@yahoo.com>

	* batchfile.c, globals.h, gtk-splitter.c:
	Fixed some typos.  Changed version declaration from an array to a preprocessor definition.
